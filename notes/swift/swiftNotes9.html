        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A for in loop executes a set of statements for each item within a range of sequence, or a collection, this is useful for repeating like a set of numbers.</p>
        <br>
        Example:
        <br>
        <br>
        For randomNumbers in 20...25 {
        <br>
        print("\(randomNumbers) has been generated")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        console output:
        <br>
        <br>
        20 has been generated 
        <br>
        21 has been generated 
        <br>
        22 has been generated 
        <br>
        23 has been generated 
        <br>
        24 has been generated 
        <br>
        25 has been generated 
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We also don't have to put the value in and can just leave it with a "_:" value.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        for _ in 1..5 {
        <br>
            print("What's up")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        what's up
        <br>
        what's up
        <br>
        what's up
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The for-in syntax can be used iterate over each item in an array.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        let phones = ["Samsung", "IPhone", "LG"] {
        <br>
        for phone in phones
        <br>
        print("My phone is a \(phones)")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Since String is a collection type it can also be used in a for in loop because it has the a similar functionalality to an array.</p>
        <br>
        for value in "XYZ" {
        <br>
        print("the letter values are \(value)")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>While loops</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A While loop will continue to loop until it's specified condition is no longer true.</p>
        <br>
        var counter = 21 
        <br>
        <br>
        while counter > 12 {
        <br>
        <br>
        CountNumbers()
        <br>
        UpdateCounter()
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        var counter = 21 
        <br>
        var countNumbers = true 
        <br>
        while countNumbers {
        <br>
        counter += 1
        <br>
        if counter == 0 {
        <br>
        countNumbers = false
        <br>
        }
        <br>
    }
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Control Transfer Statements</h2>
        <br>
        <p>There is a swift key where if you put a break it will stop the loop.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        for serialNumbers in 2368493 {
        <br>
        print(serialNumbers)
        <br>
        if serialNumbers == 3 {
        <br>
            break
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        }
        <br>
