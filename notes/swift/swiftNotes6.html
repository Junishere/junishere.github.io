        <h2>Structures</h2>
        <p>the word struct means that it is listing out the variables and constants declorations with the type of annotation</p>
        <p>this is used to define the properties and showing how to use a name property</p>
        <br>
        example:
        <br>
        <br>
        struct gamerTag {
        <br>
        var realName: String
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <P>Access data is stored in it's properties such as the person's realName using the dot syntax</P>
        <br>
        let gamer = gamerTag(realName: "Branden")
        <br>
        print(gamer.realName)
        <br>
        <br>
        console output
        <br>
        <br>
        Branden
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The second exapmle shown here is also using the dot syntax methodwith the structure</p>
        <br>
        struct personUserName {
        <br>
        var firstName: String
        <br>
        func introduceMyself {
        <br>
        print("Yo, my name is \(firstName)")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        }
        <p>Then it can be called by using the dot syntax</p>
        <br>
        let person = personUserName(firstName: "Branden")        
        <br>
        personUserName.introduceMyself()
        <br>
        <br>
        console output
        <br>
        <br>
        Yo, my name is Branden
        <br>
        <h2>Instances</h2>
        <p>For this proccess the instance must be created which is initialization, and it inherits all properties and features of structure</p>
        <br>
        struct homework {
        <br>
        var math: math
        <br>
        var science: Science
        <br>
        var languages: languages
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Another example is by defining the attributes with the homework</p>
        <p>Then there is the structure definition and it involves functonality being added which gives out a description of the instance values</p>

        struct gamingComputer {
        <br>
        var brand: String
        <br>
        var GPU: String
        <br>
        var CPU: String
        <br>
        var storageNumber: Int
        <br>
        <br>
        func aboutComputer {
        <br>
        print("The gaming spec are \(GPU), \(CPU), and has \(storageNumber) amount of storage.")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        <br>
        func playingComputer {
        <br>
        print("I'm running overwatch with the specs running with \(GPU), a \(CPU), and has \(storageNumber) gbs there.")
        <br>
        }
        <br>
        let firstGamingPC = gamingComputer(brand: "CyberPower", GPU: "RTX 2080", CPU: "intel core i9", storageNumber: "3000")
